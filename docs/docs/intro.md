# Overview

Throughout an exploratory experience, I've been noticed that in different projects, our API's endpoints aren't structured appropriately, or rather, it is merely tough to scale them by repeting some URLs.

Hence this is a distinct approach to organizing and creating endpoints easily and quickly; regardless of what kind of framework or library you are using, you can undoubtedly make it part of that.

How to serve these entities to access services is a blend of Redux approach and how we create endpoints in backend frameworks such as Express, Fastify, etc.
